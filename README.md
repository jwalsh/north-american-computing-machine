# Take-away

- Know where to start 
- Start out with the trivial cases
- Be willing to cheat to get a passing test
- Recognize duplication 
- Accept the understanding of the problem domain can be driven by the
  tests
- If blocked on a case that doesn't push forward a pattern ignore then
  problem and expand domain knowledge in the understood area 
- Focus on readability 
- Expand edge cases as understanding becomes more robust
